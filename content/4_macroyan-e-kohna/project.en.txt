Description: For my thesis exhibition at Yale, I created a nineteen-foot-long panoramic textile artwork that was inspired by Seurat’s A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte. Like Seurat, I wanted to capture a more contemporaneous scene of my childhood home of Kabul City, Afghanistan. The space depicted here is Macroyan Kohna—a neighborhood which was constructed under the Russian occupation of Kabul in the early 1960s. This particular piece shows the shift in power that occurred after the American invasion ended the Taliban regime in 2001. The men and women depicted in this hopeful image now walk freely and leisurely within Macroyan.
