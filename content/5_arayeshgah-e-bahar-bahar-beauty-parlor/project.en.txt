Description: While visiting Afghanistan in 2013, I had the opportunity to witness a few of my cousins getting married. I became fascinated with the salons they attended to decorate themselves for their wedding dayâ€”that is when I decided I needed to explore this scene further. I combined my memories of that visit with my interests in Afghan standards of beauty and geopolitics into this specific salon scene. Women are seen congregating inside the beauty parlor, while a figure with a camouflage uniform stands guard outside. Even though the salon space itself is freeing for women, the realities of the region are still visible through this male chaperon.
