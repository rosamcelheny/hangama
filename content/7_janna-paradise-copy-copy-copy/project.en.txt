Description: Kabul Diaries is a series of 8" x 10" paintings from memory that explored my experiences of being surrounded by a community of Afghan women in rural valleys and more urban cities around Kabul, Afghanistan. I documented their hybrid lifestyles and portrayed intimate moments such as shopping, swimming with aunts and cousins at secret ponds, gossiping, spending time at home, and lounging around outdoors.
