Description: This installation at the Banff Center for the Arts and Creativity depicts the Canadian Rocky Mountains of western Canada, a contemporaneous landscape that geographically echoed my own memories growing up in the mountainous regions of Afghanistan. I utilized the colors of the sublime landscapes of Banff, Yoho, and Jasper National Park as a vehicle to explore the topography of western Canada in relation to my changing sense of place as a first-generation Afghan-Canadian woman.
