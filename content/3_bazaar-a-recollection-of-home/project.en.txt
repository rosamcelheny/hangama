Description: Bazaar, A Recollection of Home, is a textile project reminiscing on the bazaar environment in fabric. My interest in bazaars as sites of social and economic exchange comes from my childhood experiences in my birthplace Kabul, Afghanistan from 1994-1996, just before the Taliban regime came to power.
