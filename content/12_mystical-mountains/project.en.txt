Description: Mystical Mountains is a series of oil paintings on wood panel that reflects the artist's past memories of her homeland, growing up in the mountainous landscape of Afghanistan. The works depict the Rocky Mountain range of western Canada, finding a cultural echo of her childhood memories through a contemporary Canadian landscape. Capturing the sublime nature of Banff, Yoho, and Jasper National Park, her work utilizes colour and natural landscape as a vehicle to explore her identity within a changing sense of place.
